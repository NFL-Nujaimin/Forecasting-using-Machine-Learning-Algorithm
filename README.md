# Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This project forecasts public transport ridership in Selangor, Malaysia, using data from Malaysia Open Source. It employs data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms (linear regression and neural networks) for accurate predictions. 

This repository has 2 file which has 2 different machine learning algorithm (Linear Regression and Neural Network). Both file employes the same data preprocessing stages. Data preprocessing includes:
- Import Libraries
- Delete unwanted features
- create new column for target
- Calculating Z score to identify and handle outliers
- Normalization
- L2 Regularization

The algorithm accuracy is calculated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Both algorithm manage to pass the prediction.
